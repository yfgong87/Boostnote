  # Permission
  While declaring a permission is required for using the camera, directly dialing the phone, and directly accessing the contact database - you can do each of these things by using a system app as an intermediator. Because the camera app, dialer, and contacts app will be used to provide the data you request - users have the chance to cancel the action you initiated, giving them runtime ability to refuse your app access.
  Your app can only access the userâ€™s location if it explicitly declares a uses-permission.
  ```xml
  <!-- Add permission to internet in AndroidManifest.xml -->
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>
  ```
  # Error Associated with No permission
  java.lang.SecurityException: Permission denied (missing INTERNET permission?)
